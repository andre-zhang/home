			<h2 id = "intro">Welcome! In our world right now, we are facing multiple challenges. 
			But perhaps, the two main ones are a changing climate and rapid population growth.
			On this website, we'll explore a unique, little discussed solution to these problems - sustainable cities.
			We'll look at ways to build sustainable cities through the lens of transportation, development and energy, and discuss why we need to start implementing these concepts now!</h2>

			<h3 id = "developt">Sustainable Development</h3>
				<p id = "develop">In this section, we'll look at how we can expand cities in a more sustainable way. 
				We'll explore alternatives to the infamous urban sprawl and look at ways to help existing urban sprawl communities become more sustainable. 
				Read more about <a href = "page2.html"> sustainable development.</a></p>

			<h3 id = "transportt">Sustainable Transportation</h3>
				<p id = "transport"> In this section, we'll look at how we can move people around different communities with different needs. 
				We'll explore the war on the car, and how drivers, transit, cyclists and pedestrians can co-exist. 
				Finally, we'll look at an example of an excellent public transportation network and examine why it's so successful.

				<!-- I can only go up to h6 so after that, I'm going to use tags-->

			<h3 id = "energyt">Sustainable Energy</h3>
				<p id = "energy"> In this section, we'll look at how we use energy and why we need it. 
				Then, we'll explore why Canadian energy is some of the best in the world and ways for us to take advantage of it. 
				Despite this, we still need to begin moving towards cleaner energy - and we'll look at how cities around the world are doing that and see what we can learn from them.

			<h3 id = "otherwayst">Other Ways to Build Sustainable Cities</h3>
				<p id = "otherways"> In this section, we'll look at other ways to build sustainable cities.
				We'll explain why we need to bridge the gap between urban and rural communities, and how we can bring farms into cities.
				Then, we'll look at how we can build cities that are resistant to climate change and have smaller ecological footprints.
				Finally, we'll end off by looking at an example of a sustainable city that exemplifies everything we've discussed on this webpage.
